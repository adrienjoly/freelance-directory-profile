# freelance-directory-profile

In this repo, I maintain a [`freelance-directory-profile.xml`](https://github.com/adrienjoly/freelance-directory-profile/blob/master/freelance-directory-profile.xml) file, containing my expertise, rate, availability and preferences for freelancing work.

If you think that you will want to share relevant freelance gigs with me in the future, please **subscribe to my updates** by watching this GitHub repository, and use [freelance-directory-client](https://adrienjoly.com/freelance-directory-client) to help you integrate these changed into your Google Contacts directory.

If you want to receive relevant freelance gigs from your peers, fork this repository and share its URL with them!
