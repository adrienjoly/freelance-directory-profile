# freelance-directory-profile

In this repo, I maintain a [`freelance-directory-profile.xml`](https://github.com/adrienjoly/freelance-directory-profile/blob/master/freelance-directory-profile.xml) file, containing my expertise, rate, availability and preferences for freelance work.

You're considering to share relevant freelance gigs with me in the future? If so, please **watch this GitHub repository**, and use [freelance-directory-client](https://adrienjoly.com/freelance-directory-client) to help you integrate these changes into your Google Contacts account.

You want to receive relevant freelance gigs from your peers? Fork this repository and share its URL with them!
